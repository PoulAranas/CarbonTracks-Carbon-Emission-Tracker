# CarbonTracks: The Carbon Emission Tracker

## Overview
This program calculates emissions, travel time, and eco-scores for different modes of transport: Bike, Jeepney, and Car. 
It aims to encourage eco-friendly travel choices by providing users with insightful transport metrics.

## Application of Python Concepts
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - **Abstraction:** Implemented through the `Transport` abstract class.
   - **Inheritance:** Specialized classes (`Bike`, `Jeepney`, `Car`) inherit from the `Transport` class.
   - **Encapsulation:** Used for organizing data and methods within transport and route classes.

2. **Polymorphism:**
   - Each transport mode (`Bike`, `Jeepney`, `Car`) implements its unique behavior for emissions, travel time, and eco-score calculation.

## SDG 13: Climate Action
This program supports Sustainable Development Goal 13 by raising awareness about carbon emissions in daily travel. 
By comparing the eco-score and emissions of various transport modes, users are encouraged to choose environmentally friendly options like biking.
